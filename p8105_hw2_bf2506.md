### Problem 2

##### 1.Read and clean Mrtrash_data

``` r
Mrtrash_wheel_data =  
  readxl::read_excel("./data/Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx",
  sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
  range = "A2:N549" )
```

``` r
Mrtrash_wheel_data = janitor::clean_names(Mrtrash_wheel_data) %>% rename(volume_cubicyards = volume_cubic_yards) %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = round(sports_balls)) %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls), year = as.double(year)) 
```

##### 2.Read and clean Professortrash_data

``` r
Professortrash_wheel_data = 
  readxl::read_excel("./data/Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx",
  sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel", 
  range = "A2:M96") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  rename(volume_cubicyards = volume_cubic_yards)
```

##### 3.Combine two tables

``` r
Mrtrash_wheel_data = 
  mutate(Mrtrash_wheel_data, trash_wheel = "Mr_Trash_Wheel")

Professortrash_wheel_data =
  mutate(Professortrash_wheel_data, trash_wheel = "Professor_Trash_Wheel")

Trash_Wheel_data = 
  bind_rows(Mrtrash_wheel_data, Professortrash_wheel_data) %>% relocate(trash_wheel)
```

**Describe the Data form Trash_Wheel_data**

The size of the dataset is **15 variables** and **641 observations**,
showing the summary of trash collection from two trash wheel(Mr.trash
wheel and Professor trash wheel). And the total weight of trash
collected by Professor Trash Wheel is190.12 tons and the total number of
sports balls collected by Mr. Trash Wheel in 2020 is 856

**15** variables are as following:  
**·trash_wheel**: whether from “Mr_Trash_Wheel” or
“Professor_Trash_Wheel” <br> **·dumpster**: the number of dumpsters <br>
**·month**: the month that collect the data, from Jan to Dec <br>
**·year**: the year that collect the data <br> **·date**: the date that
collect the data <br> **·weight_tons**: weight in tons <br>
**·volume_cubicyards**: volume in cubic yards <br> **·plastic_bottles**:
the number of plastic bottles <br> **·polystyrene**: the number of
polystyrene <br> **·cigarette_butts**: the number of cigarette butts
<br> **·glass_bottles**: the number of glass bottles <br>
**·grocery_bags**: the number of grocery bags <br> **·chip_bags**: the
number of chip bags <br> **·sports_balls**：the number of sports balls
<br> **·homes_powered**: the number of homes powered by electricity
generated from these trash <br>

### Problem 3

##### 1.Clean the data in pols-month.csv

``` r
pols_month_data =
  read_csv("./data/pols-month.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "\\-") %>% 
  mutate( year = as.integer(year), month = as.integer(month), day = as.integer(day)) %>% 
  mutate( month = month.abb[month]) %>%
  mutate(president = ifelse(prez_gop - prez_dem > 0, "gop", "dem")) %>% 
  select(-c(prez_gop, prez_dem, day))
```

##### 2.Clean the data in snp.csv

``` r
snp_data =
  read_csv("./data/snp.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(date = lubridate::mdy(date)) %>% 
  separate(date, into = c("year", "month", "day"), convert = TRUE ) %>% 
  select(-day) %>% 
  mutate( year = ifelse( year < 2050, as.integer(year),  as.integer(year - 100) )) %>%  
  arrange(year, month) %>% 
  mutate(month = month.abb[month]) %>% 
  select(year, month, everything())
```

##### 3.Tidy unemployment data

``` r
unemployment_data = 
  read_csv("./data/unemployment.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  pivot_longer(jan:dec, names_to = "month", values_to = "unemployment_percentage") %>% 
  mutate(month = sub("(.)", "\\U\\1", month, perl = TRUE), year = as.integer(year))
```

##### 4.Joint pols_month/snp/unemployment tables

``` r
pols_snp_unemployment_data = 
  left_join(pols_month_data, snp_data, by = c("year", "month")) %>% 
  left_join(unemployment_data, by = c("year", "month")) %>% 
  select(year, month, close, unemployment_percentage, president, everything())
```

##### 5.Describe these tables

**pols_month_data** is related to the number of national politicians who
are democratic or republican per month from January 1947 to June 2015
and contains 822 observations of 9 variables (“year”,
“month，”president”, “gov_gop”, “sen_gop”, “rep_gop”, “gov_dem”,
“sen_dem”, “rep_dem”)

**snp_data** is related to Standard & Poor’s stock market index (a
representative measure of the stock market as a whole) per month from
January 1950 to July 2015 and contains 787 observations of 3 variables
(“year”, “month”, “close”)

**unemployment_data** is related to percentage of unemployment per month
from January 1948 to December 2015 and contains 816 observations of 3
variables (“year”, “month”, “unemployment_percentage”)

**pols_snp_unemployment_data** is merged by pols_month_data, snp_data
and unemployment_data, related to the number of national politicians who
are democratic or republican/S&P index/ unemployment percentage. The 3
in 1 table contains 822 observations and 11 variables per year from
January 1947 to June 2015. Some key variables are as following:

**year** : the year of the observations on that row <br> **month** : the
month of the observations on that row <br> **close** : the closing
values of the S&P stock index <br> **unemployment** : the percentage of
unemployment <br> **president** : whether the president was dem or gop

### Problem 1

##### 1.Read and clean and select NYC_subway_data

``` r
NYC_subway_data = 
  read_csv(
    "./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv",
    col_types = cols(Route8 = "c", Route9 = "c", Route10 = "c", Route11 = "c")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(
    line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, 
    starts_with("route"), entry, exit_only, vending, entrance_type, ada) %>% 
  mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE))
```

##### 2.Describe NYC_subway_data

I import data from `NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv`. The
process begins with data import, updates variable names, and selects the
columns that will be used in later parts. We update `entry` from `yes` /
`no` to a logical variable. As part of data import, we specify that
`Route` columns 8-11 should be character for consistency with
1-7.(1868rows x 20columns)

As it stands, these data are not “tidy”: route number should be a
variable, as should route. That is, to obtain a tidy dataset we would
need to convert `route` variables from wide to long format. This will be
useful when focusing on specific routes, but may not be necessary when
considering questions that focus on station-level variables.

##### 3.Calculate number of distinct stations

``` r
NYC_subway_data %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct
```
